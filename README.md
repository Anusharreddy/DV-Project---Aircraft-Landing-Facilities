# Aircraft Landing Facilities in the USA – Tableau Dashboard Analysis

This project presents a comprehensive Tableau dashboard analysis of **aircraft landing facilities across the United States**, highlighting trends in aviation infrastructure, operations, and their regional economic impact. The insights are derived from public datasets and visualized to support informed decision-making in aviation planning and development.

## Project Summary
The project was inspired by real-world aviation safety concerns and aims to assess the current state of U.S. landing infrastructure. It focuses on:
- Evaluating the **distribution and types of landing facilities** (airports, heliports, gliderports, etc.)
- Analyzing **passenger flow, arrivals/departures**, and **air traffic density**
- Identifying relationships between **facility location, economic activity**, and **operational readiness**

## Key Dashboards

### 1. **Top Cities & Facility Ownership**
- Visualizes city-wise landing facility counts and passenger volume
- Shows ownership breakdown (public, private, military)

### 2. **State-wise Air Travel Insights**
- Enplanement, departures, and arrivals by state
- Identifies top-performing states in air traffic (e.g., Texas, Florida, California)

### 3. **Regional Accessibility & Economic Impact**
- Maps facility types and proximity to Central Business Districts (CBDs)
- Highlights how aviation infrastructure supports regional economies

### 4. **Operational Capabilities & Aviation Support**
- Compares states on control towers, customs/international support
- Evaluates readiness for local, military, and itinerant operations

### 5. **Facility Type and Elevation Analysis**
- Compares elevation distribution of various landing facility types
- Shows usage trends and ownership across altitude ranges
